Please modify the variable ‘address’ in the mainPY file to the address of the example data(can be accessed via XXX).  
We use 'Mrtrix3' for estimating response function(or use response1.nii directly) and constrained spherical deconvolution(CSD), it can be downloaded via 'https://www.mrtrix.org/download/'.  
The program will generate a FOD file which can be viewed with 'mrview' in 'Mrtrix3', open the FOD file and use 'ODF Display' in 'Tools' to view the FOD file.
